## Building from source

### Requirements

- Linux-based system
- libevdev library
- Root permissions (to access input devices)

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tylerboni/flipmouse.git
   cd flipmouse
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install libevdev-dev
   ```

   ```
   # Arch
   sudo pacman -S libevdev
   ```

3. Compile the code:

   ```
   # Debug flag builds for linux desktop and runs
   ./make-mouse [--debug]
   ```

4. To install:
   ```
   ./install
   ```

## How It Works

FlipMouse works by:

1. Finding and grabbing supported input devices
2. Creating a virtual mouse device using libevdev
3. Intercepting key events and converting them to mouse movements when in mouse mode
4. Passing through normal key events when not in mouse mode

## Supported Devices

Currently supported devices:

- TCL FLIP 2
- AT Translated Set 2 keyboard (standard laptop keyboards)
